# SaveSquad

## Project Description

### Saving Is Better‚Ä¶ With Frens! ü™ô
Save Squad lets you team up with friends to save towards a common goal‚Äîand earn something extra along the way!<br />
Whether it's getting to Devcon, throwing an epic birthday party, or snagging that pilot license, set a squad target amount and keep each other on track.<br /> 
The best part? Your contributions are pooled together and staked, growing your savings over time. At the end of your set period, everyone gets their share of the rewards!<br />

### The Rules üïπÔ∏è
Create Your Squad: Start by setting up the squad and defining the goal, squad size, contribution amounts, frequency, and due date.<br />
Invite Your Crew: Bring in your friends and start contributing. Stay on track to maximize your rewards‚Äîbeing late could mean a deduction in your prize!<br />
Reap the Rewards: At the end, each member gets their savings plus a share of the staking rewards. Then, let the fun begin!<br />

## The Stack: what we used

The platform operates through a smart contract on Rootstock, which manages the creation of pools, deposits, and withdrawals.<br />
This contract also interfaces with the staking protocol to deposit pooled tokens.<br />
SaveSquad utilizes Warp Routes by Hyperlane to swap USDC from multiple chains to wUSDC on Rootstock, ensuring seamless interaction within the platform.<br />
